# Graphs

Q: What are Graphs? :   
A: a set of values that are related in an pair-wise fashion

Q: What are they useful for? :  
A: Graphs are used for representing networks of communication, 
    data organization, computational devices, the flow of computation, they can be used to represent relations of things

Q: What are theyu similar too? :    
A: similar to an network

Statement: Graphs have edges ( branch connections ) just as Trees do

Statement: Nodes are the same as Vertices, a Node is also an Vertex 
 
Q: What is an Directed Graph? :    
A: useful for describing traffic-flow, in this type of graph flow of traffic is
   only mono-directional

Q: What is an Undirected Graph? :     
A: unidirected graphs allow for multi-directional travel

Q: What are Weighted Graphs? :     
A: The below graph is a weighted graph, placed on their edges are numerical vals 

Q: What are unweighted graphs? :   
A: unweighted graphs are graphs without weights

Statement : With graphs we can insert data on the edges or branches along with the nodes

                 2  
          ( 1 ) ---- (10)       
     12  /     \ -2     \ 2
        /       \       (8)
    ( 2 ) ------ ( 3 )           
        \        /    
     1   \      / 10   
           ( 9 )          
                     
             

Q: What is a cyclic graph? :    
A: a cyclic graph is a directed graph which contains a path from at least one node back to itself

            O
            | \
            |   O   notice the full path from root node - back to root node
            |  /
            O/

Q: What is a non-cyclic graph? :    
A: a graph which contains no cycle

            O
            | \
            |   O   notice the no-full path from root node - back to root node
            |       
            O      

Q: what is Adjacency list? :    
A: an adjacency list is a collection of unordered lists used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a vertex in the graph. This is one of several commonly used representations of graphs for use in computer programs.
